Orbán spoke on Thursday ...  \n","Prime Minister Viktor Orbán spoke on Thursday at a panel discussion about US-Hungarian relations hosted by the conservative-Trumpist Heritage Foundation in Washington, DC, Bertalan Havasi, the Prime Minister's press chief, told MTI. The discussion with the Hungarian Prime Minister was hosted by Kevin Roberts, the president of Heritage Foundation, while the audience included some of the most prominent American right-wing politicians, analysts and public figures. The event was opened by American far-right politician and former Republican presidential candidate, Vivek Ramaswamy, who said that \"the world needs a movement that fights for truth, for tradition, for families, for people\".\n","\n","The Heritage Foundation has been a major think tank of the American right for decades, and according to Kevin Roberts, its new goal is to institutionalise Trumpism. As the article of 444 recalls, the foundation is campaigning against helping Ukraine and is advocating for Americans using more fossil fuels.\n","\n","At the foundation's private panel discussion, Viktor Orbán was asked about the successes and challenges of Hungary's conservative family and economic policies, the war in Ukraine, US-Hungarian relations, President Trump and his personal political credo.\n","\n","Photo: The Prime Minister's Press Office / Zoltán Fischer / MTVA\n","\n","Following the event, at the Hungarian Embassy in Washington, the Hungarian Prime Minister met with US media personality and political strategist Steve Bannon, who was an advisor to former President Donald Trump. Bannon gave a a talk in Hungary in 2018, and although there were empty chairs in the auditorium, the organisers at the time said that there was no room for the press. He was later convicted of fraud and money laundering, but was pardoned by Trump on his last day as president.\n"]}],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","from newspaper import Article\n","\n","# Adatok betöltése DataFrame-be\n","df = pd.read_csv(\"telex_english_news.csv\")\n","\n","# Cikkek tartalmának letöltése\n","for index, row in df.iterrows():\n","    link = row['Link']\n","    article = Article(link)\n","    article.download()\n","    article.parse()\n","    text = article.text\n","    # A cikk tartalmának hozzáadása a DataFrame-hez\n","    df.at[index, 'Text'] = text\n","\n","df.to_csv(\"telex_news_with_summary.csv\", index=False)\n","\n","# DataFrame tartalmának kiírása\n","print(df)\n","print(df.loc[9, 'Text'])\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":387},"id":"FB_Jj5fptaEZ","outputId":"0af05a75-cdec-4a03-ed82-f9bcc97c21e8"},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["/home/kmark7/pysorflow/lib/python3.11/site-packages/tqdm/auto.py:21: TqdmWarning: IProgress not found.
